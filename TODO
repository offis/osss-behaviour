| TODO List for the Program-State Machine (PSM) simulation library       |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 This library based on SystemC supports a subset of hierarchical behaviours
 also known as "Program State-Machines" (PSM) from SpecC.
 
 - get positional binding working
 - (re)enable call of osss_seq, osss_par, osss_pipe & osss_fsm from within
    main method
 
 - multi-dimensional arrays (based on osss_array<T, Size>)
 
 - change binding policy of osss_in, osss_out and osss_inout to
   allow more than a single port to port binding
 - osss_export
 - revise osss_shared_variable and ports for direct access to 
   complex user-defined data (like structs or classes) via the
   operator->()
 
 - make osss_module handle clock and reset registry
     -> move global_clock_registry to osss_module OR better implement
        another loacl clock registry.
 - what about hierarchical reset? 
   + only call reset part of root SC_CTHREAD? <-- not appropriate since we
     want to get rid of SC_CTHREADs and only use SC_THREADs
   + call special reset()/init() methods in each sub-behaviour?
 
 - implementation of more SpecC pre-defined channels

Future TODOs:
 - what about traps and interrupts (hierarchical exceptions)?
