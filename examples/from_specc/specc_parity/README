This directory contains an example in SpecC language which describes the 
the SpecC design methodology. We implement the parity checker which calculates
the even parity of the unsigned integer number (will be refined into 32-bit
vector).

Directory structure:

	spec/    - specification model for parity checker
	arch/    - architecture model for parity checker
	comm/    - communication model for parity checker
	rtl/     - behavioral RTL model for parity checker

Each directory has a makefile to compile the SpecC codes and to generate an
executable binary for the simulation. Simply, you can compile them by:

	make

The executable binary file for the simulation is "tb".
You can run it by:

	./tb

Have fun with the parity checker !
