This package contains the Program-State Machine (PSM) simulation library:
=========================================================================

This is the first beta release of the PSM (Program-State Machine)
library for modelling a subset of the SpecC language for
the specification and refinement of Hardware/Software systems.

We just provide a proof of concept library, which needs to be further
improved. Some urgent TODOs can be found in the TODO file.

The PSM library is based or inspired by the OSSS (Oldenburg System Synthesis 
Subset) library that is also available under LGPL 
from http://www.system-synthesis.org

0. Requirements
---------------

  + SystemC library version 2.2.0
  + GNU GCC/G++ at least version 3.4.4
  + GNU Make (at least version 3.79)

1. Running the examples:
-----------------------

You obviously already managed the first two steps:

  + Download the PSM library from http://www.system-synthesis.org
  + Untar it to a directory of your choice:
      gunzip -c osss-psm-0.0.1.tar.gz | tar xvf -

Prepare your environment:

  + set environment variable SYSTEMC_HOME to your SystemC
    installation path (at least version 2.2.0)
    - bash:
      export SYSTEMC_HOME=<path_to_systemc>
    - csh (tcsh,...)
      setenv SYSTEMC_HOME <path_to_systemc>
  + you might need to set the environment variable
    SYSTEMC_LIB as well, if your SystemC installation
    differs from a standard SystemC installation.

Compile the library:

  + all parts of the library are compiled on demand along
    with the examples

Compile the examples:

  + change to the examples directory:
      "cd examples"
  + you can either compile and run all examples from
    the top-level examples directory by typing
      "make sim"
  + or you can change directly into each example subdirectory
    and also type
      "make sim"
  + the from_specc directory contains some advanced examples,
    for compilation and execution please consult the README file
    located in the from_specc directory

2. Usage:
---------

To use the PSM library in your SystemC projects just copy a
Makefile from the exmaples to your project.
Make shure that all settings in this file are adopted to your
environemnt:

  + MODULE:= my_project_name
    This should be the name of your project, the resulting executable
    will be named my_project_name.x

  + SRCDIRS := . ../../src
    This should point to the source directory of the PSM simulation
    library

  + EXTRA_INCLUDES := -I. -I../../src
    This should also point to the source directory of the PSM
    simulation library

  + OSSS_BUILD_RULES := ../../build/Makefile.osss
    This should point to the buid directory of the PSM simulation
    library

3. Doxygen generated documentation:
-----------------------------------

Doxygen generated documentation can be found at the doc/htlm directory
in the PSM library top-level directory

4. Further Information
----------------------

Until now this code is not documented very well.
You are encouraged to check http://www.system-synthesis.org for further updates.
